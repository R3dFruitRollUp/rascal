Non-self links and links detected in posts\r\nwill be opened in your default browser.\r\n\r\n![screenщhot](https://github.com/soli/rascal/raw/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n(in case you wonder, my iTerm2 is using the dark\r\n[solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color scheme.)\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\n\r\nPlease note that rascal is my first Haskell project. As such, it is as much a\r\nfun experiment for me to discover the ecosystem and the idiodms, than it is a\r\nreally useful project. TL;DR: YMMV.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
