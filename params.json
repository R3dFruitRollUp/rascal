For instance, it might contain the following (case-sensitive!):\r\n\r\n```\r\nsubreddit: programming\r\nlinkSort = controversial\r\ncommentSort: new\r\npageComments = True\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is what rascal looks like when started, and when a _self_ link (marked\r\nwith a '♦') is chosen (`N` was pressed in this case). Non-self links and links\r\ndetected in posts will be opened in your default browser.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://github.com/soli/rascal/raw/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nComments are shown threaded, with the order defined in the configuration file\r\n(defaulting to `new`), and one page at a time if `pageComments` is true\r\n(default). Comments, like posts, are formatted to avoid cutting words when\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n![threads](https://github.com/soli/rascal/raw/master/threads.png)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nIn case you wonder, my iTerm2 is using the dark\r\n[solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color scheme. The ASCII\r\ntitle was generated with `figlet -f chunky`. And the name comes from my own\r\npronunciation of `/r/haskell`.\r\n\r\n### Planned Features\r\n\r\n* Configuration for colors\r\n* OAuth2 login to reddit (subscribed/saved/etc.)\r\n* more tests\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\nPlease note that rascal is my first Haskell project. As such, it is as much a\r\nfun experiment for me to discover the ecosystem and the idioms, than a really\r\nuseful project. TL;DR: YMMV.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
