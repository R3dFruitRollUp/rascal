rascal
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soli/soli.png)](https://travis-ci.org/soli/soli)

rascal is a command-line client for [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/).

It should work on any platform where Haskell runs (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows
through MinGW), and aims at making available the whole reddit API (we're not
there yetâ€¦).

It sports colors, that should soon become configurable, and might not work
under Windows (based on ANSI escape sequences, through
[ansi-terminal](https://github.com/batterseapower/ansi-terminal)).

By default it will open [/r/haskell](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/new)
sorted by "new", but you can provide another subreddit as argument on the
command line

```
$ rascal python
```
